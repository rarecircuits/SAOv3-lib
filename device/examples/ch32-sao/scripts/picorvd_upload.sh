# Flash a firmware ELF to a CH32V00x target through a picorvd probe (RP2040).
#
# Recovers on its own where it can. The SWIO link to the target drops
# intermittently, and the symptoms are unhelpful: gdb hangs forever on
# "target extended-remote" rather than erroring, because picorvd's stub only
# accepts an attach while the target is halted. So the link is checked FIRST and
# repaired before gdb is ever launched:
#
#   1. part_id reads a plausible value                -> go
#   2. otherwise init_swio, a few times               -> usually enough
#   3. otherwise restart the probe (2400 baud touch)  -> as good as replugging
#   4. otherwise give up with an actionable message   -> needs halt_on_reset
#
# Environment overrides:
#   PICORVD_PORT     GDB server port (skips autodetection)
#   PICORVD_CONSOLE  console port
#   PICORVD_GDB      path to a RISC-V gdb
#   PICORVD_NO_HALT  set to 1 to skip the automatic halt
#   PICORVD_TIMEOUT  seconds before a stuck gdb is killed (default 60)
