# Shared helpers for talking to a picorvd probe (an RP2040 acting as a
# ch32v003 debugger). Sourced by picorvd_upload.sh and picorvd_restart.sh.
#
# picorvd enumerates two CDC ACM interfaces: the lower-numbered one is the
# interactive console, the higher-numbered one is the GDB server. Which names
# they get depends on which physical USB port the probe is plugged into, so
# they are resolved at run time rather than hardcoded.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   PICORVD_PORT     GDB server port (skips autodetection)
#   PICORVD_CONSOLE  console port
#   PICORVD_GDB      path to a RISC-V gdb

# Magic baud rates, handled in src/usb/usb_task.cpp on the probe:
#   1200 -> reboot into the BOOTSEL loader (for reflashing the probe itself)
#   2400 -> restart the firmware
# Both are serviced by the USB task, which runs at a higher FreeRTOS priority
# than the shell (3 vs 2), so they still work when the shell task is wedged.
